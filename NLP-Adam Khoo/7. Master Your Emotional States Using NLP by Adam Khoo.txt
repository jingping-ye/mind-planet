how many of you want to create  breakthrough results in your life in  terms of income in your business  somebody say I okay let me ask you this  what precedes results what precedes any  result action that true you can talk all  you want you can think all you want but  unless you pick some kind of action you  don't get any one way down right for  example if you want to lose weight what  action must you take you must go  exercise go workout  go eat certain foods avoid certain foods  yes or no if you want to increase your  net worth what actions must you take  every day focus on managing your money  focus on your investments focus on  building additional strips of in come  not once a week once about every day  that's make sense okay now how many of  you many times in your life  you said yourself yes yes yes I know  what to do I know how to do I just never  do come at you or have you do for a  while like reading is three weeks and  then after you don't follow true enough  to get the result you want come to view  okay let's explore whining and help  overcome it okay now question guys what  stops us from taking the action that we  need every day to get the result what  what stops us come on tell me what stops  us now you see I want to go to the gym  to exercise ba a lazy baby we really say  it's not about time cuz we all have 24  hours right that's an excuse that's not  true right what three something else  distractions okay distractions again  what else we say okay you know I always  wanted to start that business but fear  thank you right what else  now how do you feel that cell  often pulls you back okay and I know one  size of a pea  yeah procrastination procrastination is  the number one killer of all success not  born killer how many of you progressive  those who are not raising your hands you  know I'm your professor sitting again  right now on the other hand how many of  you here have you feel that if you had a  lot more motivation a lot more self  motivation have you think that to dare  you be a lot more successful alright you  know that right  how do you think that if you had a lot  more confidence today you would have  achieved a lot more you have you think  so yeah how do you think that if you had  a lot more focus you had a lot more  determination again you would have  achieved a lot more in your life have  you agree that right so in other words  this has been stopping us from taking  one action but this is what we need to  drive us to take the action to get  results of you now what are all these  things called  because these are affecting our life  every day right so what are all these  days wrong  think simple things simple what what  what what sphere what was confidence  what are all these things calm yes these  are all core emotions  there's nothing but emotional states yes  or no emotions is fear and emotion years  alone it's a feeling that you get is  confidence and emotion it's a feeling  that you get now as human beings are we  driven more by logic or more emotions  have you realized these emotions how  many times you say logically I should do  something but you don't because you  don't feel like doing it it's like  logically I should make the coke off  logically I should I should I should  whenever I write that book right but you  don't do y plus you all feel I do you  feel CN ISM of  you many times logically you know you  shouldn't do something but you doing  I logically I should do car I should  take the extra piece of chocolate cake  logically I know I should not smoke quit  smoking but you still small used to  either ha  why now it feels good so understand it  is the one it is the emotions that are  driving our actions every day so in NLP  we call it your emotional state or quite  state every silhouette state or behavior  is state driven just but all behaviors  one state driven your change of behavior  you must build to your state very  fast ok now let's do a very potent  exercise yes I want a normal day in your  life like for example thing today or  take yesterday okay with there and think  from the time you wake up in the morning  to that time you sleep at night right  now please right now right now the six  right now the six most common emotional  states you experience almost every day  because emotional states I had virtual  write down the six most common emotions  you experience almost every day okay let  me cut you alone let me cut you along  okay for example every morning you wake  up how many of you the moment you wake  up in the morning have you you wake up  if you energized and excited how do you  own you wanna me okay right now  energized  how many of you wake up the morning and  you feel the Taji  and CP I get rid of anything how can we  cut the morning and you feel very  cheerful very chirpy happy not people  like that  other people like that they go oh hi  good morning how are you today right  oh my god  I'm just kidding I'm just kidding all  right and how many know people wake up  the morning and their mommy rain  crouched in the morning my coffee  okay so right now the moment you wake up  what state are you in  are you energized excited or you let bad  you can't speak it right now because it  affects you okay next once you wake up  you go to work right now be honest  yourself the moment you walk into your  place of work what state are you in  cm stress over well sight that  passionate right now how do you feel boy  stress okay  creative life for me the moment I walk  off is a very creative I start to write  a very excited when I see a group of  people who okay  interesting a some people when they see  a growth before I could get very well  stress stop you look at a group you to  get very wet  how come it is not the external thing it  is how you're conditioned to respond to  external that changes your life isn't  okay  okay next when you are doing your work  when you when you're doing your job  whether you're in sales you're an  engineer you're right there whatever it  is or your your traders stock trader  Forex trader when you are doing your job  what state are you in are you in a very  focused state for example are you very  focused or you break distractors day  okay are you in a race stress state or  in a very calm and relaxed State are you  break creative state or you feel you  know very light poor and stuck still  write it down we're not doing your job  you feel very confident or you have a  lot of self-doubt does this affect your  performance by the way hello  okay next how many of you in your life  there are certain days where things  don't go the way you want right you lost  a sale right or your your sake that's  not lost okay oh you're kidding listen  to you are there dislike that yes or no  so when that happens to you how do you  feel say what else frustrated what else  huh angry okay now do we all feel the  same way yes or no yes or no no we all  feel differently depending on how we  have been conditioned to respond  depending on our emotional programming  right like some people when things don't  go your way the moment something doesn't  go your way into a pen  they get angry they lose that this  happen happy no people that my wife is  that it  that's a programming yeah but I saw  people when things don't worry I will  did never get angry did never get angry  never you want to get depressed whole  day you get depressed why why couldn't  close the zoo what my stop-loss money  buddy cry anybody I scream the holy  alright my mother like that  my mother's better than it and some  people they don't get angry they don't  get depressed but they go out to get  fresh stress they get very a lot anxiety  rest rest  hello spring a monkey  right that's the pattern right and some  people do get angry  it'll get depressed you don't get  stressed but I get right demoralize  right you're like whatever right  break demora  I see if you read for place right it has  some people when things don't go their  way you want to get even more motivate  my lost money on that thing let's go  start another investment that cuspidor  pilots will call her a customer isn't oh  yes so my question is what is your  emotional program write it down right  now  do you get angry when things don't go  your way do you get angry is that your  pattern or do you get depressed or do  you get stressed or you get even more  motivated or you get ready Morais and  give me a combination of a few true  right you know know yourself cuz once  you pull yourself you can break through  okay you guys have at least five or six  written now I order okay you got least  five or six say I'm okay guys please  share with me shave uncle Adam tell me  all this emotional speech that you  experience everything ready go over it  what anger stress boiler noise what else  anxiety frustrated hired some boy fear  suppose it one big bigger picture is  frustrate Allah  what else CN what else mine what expecto  weight loss oh yes  happy depressed focused confident driven  anyone ruled out passion do you want  okay I see what you're doing  sadly press okay now here's the thing I  came right down I do tomorrow right but  the point is that all the emotions that  we go to every day are divided into two  categories the first account and  resourceful emotional states everything  and resourceful why because when were in  these states what happens it stops us  from taking action it holds us back  right we don't perform at the best level  we can be but the other hand these are  quite resourceful states because when  you feel confident if you passionate you  feel exciting if you motivated it drives  you to take action it brings out the  best in you you perform at your peak yes  or no  anyway now look at your list and note  this in your life every day do you have  more of these or motives if you have got  this written down put across because  this put a thing go ahead and notice do  you have one or more cross  if you go all cross who day you sign up  got this come so happy have you got more  more things great have you got more  cross have you got your number okay now  let me ask you this do you think that  these emotional programming impetus  affects your life does it affect your  career  does it affect your financial situation  as you affect your marriage takes  everything is enough you know how have  you know people who go for ourselves  people doing courses like they say ok I  own a great learn about how to trade  Forex  I don't learn about internet marketing  I'll get an MBA I'll get a look how to  do programming and they give all these  things but they don't become more  successful and they're people who may  not go for all these qualifications but  become rate success for now do you want  to know why can I show you why I know  people who have come to this program  with three MBAs I hope you have come  this one with two PhDs and they say ed  up I still don't know why I can't really  achieve much in my life and you whine  when you get an MBA PhD go for some  workshops of course it's like you're  installing my apps you're installing  apps into your computer now what if you  keep installing the air right but the  operating system is not updated it  crashes it can't execute it it kind of  freezes in them that's a big sense so  the point is this is the operating  system this is your OS if you're someone  who can be driven every single day who  can be focused every single day good not  the resilience you can learn all these  other ships it does make sense  the moment you learn to reprogram your  operating system you put in one  application you execute to its total  performance that's why I'm a bit i  aughtta my students his name is Hardy  Chong  he is from Hong Kong this is how he  talked he got three MBA he came all the  way from home  to this course and he said up this  pentose of excellence has done more for  me that there my degree and my tree MBAs  not really sorry tree masters do towada  but the last ones the MBA because it and  was after his program that he started  his own business then he became a  best-selling author he began to  experience I had all that knowledge but  I could not watch executors hope you  have seen people at that before right so  it's working on the operating system so  this program is not an application this  program is a operating system upgrade  okay okay now let me share view this  formula that transformed my life as well  it goes e plus R equals two all right  now let's all say together ready one two  three  okay what is East at for instance for  event  what's that event something that happens  to us from the external environment  right so for example you're born in a  poor family that's an event your body no  arms and no legs as an event you got  retread yes an event you get promoted as  an event wipe run minute and event while  come back there's another event so  events may seem good or may see what  then can we control every event that  happens to us no it's like as a as a  sailor wind surfer can you control where  the wind's coming from no you can so  there's no point blaming evidence to be  but a lot of people being allowed the  events to shape their thoughts emotions  actions and hands affect your wife how  come there's no so they say things like  you know because I'm born in a poor  family right no role models no capital  no account that's why I pull up right  because my boss did not encourage me you  don't give you  be sure these you know said before  training so my career going nowhere do a  lot of people say things like that yes  enough right now let me ask you this  people were chief tremendous success in  life is it because they've got perfect  events is it because everything was the  way they want because they're a perfect  family  they're perfect friends no in fact a lot  of them have one have in fact the worst  events as you heard of JK Rowling I'm  sure you heard a story right she was  suicidal at 26 years old she was on a  bunch of committing suicide wine she got  married and he and the embittered  divorce  we've been less than a year and that  same year or so the mother died of  multiple sclerosis whatever disease they  use she was depression she was near  homeless listened to the worst event or  like a Nelson Mandela Tony G over 126  years right but they believe that it is  not the event then it up is my outcome  but what it Thomas my outcome is the way  in which I choose to I respond to the  event every silhouette respond now you  can always control this but can you  control this you have a hundred percent  control over the way you choose to  respond and this is where your power  lines you can't always control the  outside world user and sometimes the  more you want to control the outside  world the more big take you yet the most  frustrating here is but you can always  control the way inside world you can  control your thoughts true you can  control your emotional states you can  control your actions and when you  control the inside or the outside world  anyone changes are you following me so  no that's okay  how many of you here have ever worked on  something before like on a on a on a  sale on a business on a relationship and  you gave it everything you got and you  did not the not the way you want that  how many of you  come on all of you should be raising  your hands all of us yes or no isn't  that an experience we all go through yes  so when that happens how do you feel  hello the ball I said what else defeat  that we offer you the same way yes or no  no because how we feel depends on how a  bit conditioned to respond to those  things
