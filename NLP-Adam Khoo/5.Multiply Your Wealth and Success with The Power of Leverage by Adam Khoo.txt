[Music]  welcome to the winning the game of life  series today I'm gonna talk about one of  the chapters in my book right and this  chapter is really called a power of  leverage now have you ever wonder why  some people can achieve so much with the  same resources as other people like what  are some people who have got you know no  money who have got no degree who have  got more talent they can't build a  billion-dollar business and create for  us to change the world I mean look at  the Bill Gates look at a Larry Ellison  look at Steve Jobs they all dropped out  of school right we had more degree Steve  Jobs had no background in engineering no  beggar in computing okay they have more  money right and they've built  billion-dollar businesses how do they do  that now at the same time there's some  people who are born in rich families  they got all that money in right or they  both to Harvard University Cambridge you  got a PhD degree a master's degrees but  they built a cheap as much why we're  gonna find out why in this video and  many times people ask me they say you  know Adam how are you able to do so much  you know you write books you speak every  day you run so many businesses you're  investor you know when you get all this  talent from where you get all this time  from now it may shock you for me to tell  you this I don't have more talent than  you okay I don't have more time than you  I've got a simply four hours a day okay  I don't have more education than some of  you I know some of you listening to this  may have masses of phd's be smarter than  me but the reason why I've achieved so  much is because I've learned to harness  the power of one secret and that's the  power of leverage  now what's leverage all about leverage  is the process of being able magnify  small results or other small efforts and  small resources create huge results now  the what leverage comes from the word  lever right if you study physics before  and basically a lever is this okay a  lever allows you to live a huge weight  with a small effort and the lever makes  use of what called the fulcrum okay with  this small amount of earth or resources  we create here  results with the money or happiness  whatever okay  so in reality what is this fulcrum you  know what we leverage on now there are  many things you never John but three  main things first thing you leverage on  other people's time you leverage on  other people's experience or talent and  finally you leverage on other people's  money  that's the secret to creating tremendous  success with minimal resources and time  so let me give you an example leveraging  other people's time is like you know  people say you know Adam how do you run  so may for example online businesses if  you go to one of my websites you go to  Adam - cool calm you will lead you to  all my other websites and I've got many  websites selling many things all around  ok I run something like 15 companies in  different areas where do I find the time  the answer is I don't ok I don't run any  of my companies I don't run any of my  websites they are run by many other  people for example all my websites they  were created by one of my friends Adam  wall okay I didn't I didn't build a  websites in fact today I don't even know  how to build a website yeah so he built  the website he created all the products  he wrote all the marketing copy he wrote  all the words right he created all the  emails he he sends the emails to all the  customers I don't know anything right  all I do is that I call it the money  okay and I enjoy the fruits so why is he  so nice to me why is Adam Bomb so nice  to Adam who well it's because he gets a  percentage of all my profits okay and by  doing it I leverage on his time I  leverage on his expertise of knowing how  to build websites cuz I don't have the  time I don't have the expertise right  but he leverages on my name on my  products on my content so leveraging is  a win-win process so in the end we both  become more successful in the process so  to leverage gotta learn how to share  basically same thing if you look at all  my companies they are run by great hits  of division and overall the around of my  group CEO his name is Patrick and he's  the man who built all my companies for  me and he allows me to write my books  and to speak on stage with all these  businesses so why is he so nice to me  because again I've  to share so he gets a percentage of my  businesses a percentage of my profits  that's leveraging on other people  strength now leveraging on other  people's talent and experience is just  as important six years ago I this idea I  said I want to create the mmq Learning  Centres that's you know most you  shouldn't centers are boring  kids hate to go to them right say I have  a good future because it's so boring and  I had this dream of creating a learning  center where kids would love to go to  because learning in the class would  become fun and we use all the  accelerated learning whole-brain  learning techniques right from speed  reading to memory skills and kids will  basically get top grades after this  learning center now here's the problem I  had no idea how to build a learning  center right you know I'm not an English  teacher I can't create English  curriculum I'm not a math teacher I can  cram math curriculum and I've got no  idea how to run a center so how did I do  it I have to leverage other people's  talent so I went out there to look for  the best English teacher I could find  and I found out that share in me who at  a time taught at the NIE  which is the Teachers College in  Singapore she teaches the Masters course  she's also the author of the Oxford  primary essentials series which teaches  English assessments all right I then  found out the PTEN who's an expert in  mathematics with 24 years of experience  writing mathematics books and teaching  kids so I went to these two experts I  say guys you're the experts in math and  English I'm not so you write the  curriculum you train all my teachers you  create all the materials and they did so  what is so nice to me again they get a  percentage of the profits right and then  once they wrote the curriculum  I built the mmm cool learning centers  now I did not know how to manage the  center and I got no time so I found  another good friend Frederick who worked  in China a time with a lot of experience  running learning centers in China and  say come back to sing about you run all  the learnings and there's you be the  managing director and he's done an  amazing job in the last five to six  years from one Center we have known so  many centers around the region  so again why is he so nice to me okay  again he's dead he gets a percentage of  the business so I leverage on all their  time all the experience and they  leverage on  my vision they leverage on my name on my  content and we both within the process  finally learn to manage or learn to  leverage on other people's money have  you ever wondered how some people with  no money always like five hundos become  billionaires how do we do it because  they use other people's money to make  more money okay let me give an example  some example of a home how you do that  right one now how do you make use of  other people's money well you can make  use of people's money  it's an investor's money bank's money so  on and so forth like when you buy a home  as an investor you're leveraging other  people's money you're leveraging on the  bank's money so if you build if you buy  a million-dollar house in Singapore for  example you don't take out a million  dollars because you can afford it very  people can't so what we do we put a a  down payment of 20% which is two hundred  thousand dollars right and we take a  loan of $800,000 we board this from the  bank we use the bank's money to help us  to make money on our investment all  right so what happens there if the  property goes up by 10 percent in value  so from 1 million the property becomes  1.1 million dollars right so what's your  profit your profit is a hundred thousand  dollars now although the property  whether by 10 percent but your rate of  return it's not ten percent it's more  because you did open up a million  dollars you put down two hundred dollars  so you made a hundred thousand out of  two hundred thousand so what's your real  rate of return  hey 50 percent right 50 percent now you  may say by Adam to board the money from  the bank I'm gonna pay interest I'm  gonna pay Texas I gotta pay you know GST  and stem duty doesn't that eat into my  return yeah but as a real estate  investor when I buy property I make sure  that it has to be rented out it must be  in a location where I can get tenants  with good rentals and the rentals I earn  pays all the interest based all the stem  UT and all the taxes  in fact in most of my properties the the  rental I get pays the installment that  pays down the principal so what does it  mean in other words I'm getting it free  I'm getting the loan free and I get a  50% return and here's the best part when  I hold this property for 25 years  every month my tenant is pay my  installment right I don't pay anything  my end of 25 years I get a free property  I get a million dollar product for free  and all I do is put on to her at all  knows that's the power of leverage and I  do the same thing in a stock market as  well and I stop monkey the same thing  right you can buy a million dollar worth  of stocks for just one hundred thousand  dollars or you can buy a hundred  thousand dollars of stock for just ten  dollars or be quite leveraging right of  course if you don't know what you're  doing and anything goes down it can lose  more money but that's when risk  management comes in and that's where the  skill comes in to make a huge amount of  money with very little effort so  remember people who achieve the greatest  success the greatest wealth are not  smarter they don't make they do have  more time than you they just want to  leverage so use the power of leverage to  your advantage  [Music]
