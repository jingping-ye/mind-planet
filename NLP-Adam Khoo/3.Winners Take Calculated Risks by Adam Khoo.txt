I welcome to the reading the game of  life series and today I like to talk  about one of the chapters taking cockpit  at risk now when I talk about risk what  comes to your mind what are the thoughts  and emotions you know are they positive  or negative and to most build a negative  when you think of risk they think of you  don't fear danger gambling speculation  you know losing but if you think about  this this is neutral wrist simply means  uncertainty of outcome and everything is  risk you cross the road that's risk  right you eat in a piece of fish that's  risk you get married that's risk that's  always risk and here's a ruin life the  amount of success that you enjoy in life  is directly proportional to the level of  risk or the level of uncertainty in  which you're willing to take that's  really nice so in other words if you  want to achieve a lot of success in  business you must a the uncertainty of  starting up disease and losing your  money and having the business go  bankrupt you're going to enjoy the  success of a joyful marriage you have to  take the risk that marriage may not work  you any divorce and lose half your house  for example right if you want to enjoy  the success of winning games you have to  play those games and be willing to and  the an serving of losing the games it's  another thing we say there's always a  premium pay for uncertainty in life  people who are willing to take more  uncertainty are paid more that's the  rule for example if you think about it  why is it that when you put the money  that's peak deposit you get less than 1%  well this is Singapore for example right  if you put your money into the real  estate market or the stock market you  can make anywhere from 10% to 50% to  400% why because in fixed deposit  there's no uncertainty it's certain you  will get your money and that's why it's  so low when I stock markets uncertain  you can make a lot you could lose it all  right and that's why there's a premium  pitch so much for that let me give you  an example if someone would work in a  career for example selling life  insurance okay and they are able to sell  500  thousand dollars of life insurance for  their company so they bring $500,000  with a fail okay how much should they  get paid what if they are fair which you  do that  it depends okay now if this person who  sells insurance a unit trust they work  in a normal bank normally to be paid  about well roughly maybe about $50,000  to $60,000 again income and that's a  fancam right by this person would work  for insurance companies okay are like an  AIA or Great Eastern or Prudential or  whatever okay and these people would  probably make about two hundred and  fifty thousand dollars okay two hundred  thousand dollars they about why they are  both doing the same job they are working  equally as hard they're getting the same  results but the person here would make  so much more money for very simple  reason because the premium fee for  insanity when you join an insurance  company again like Great Eastern or  Prudential AAA what happens is there's  no fixed base you can make a lot or make  nothing actually that's what I put so  much but you join a bank that's a six  million but what happens you bring in  customers you get something and it's  wider plates over premium paid for in  certainty now the majority of people at  lines never become really rich really  successful and really live their life to  the fullest potential for one very  simple reason because they feel risk to  them the associates so much fear to risk  because in their mind they feel that  they can't control the outcome it is out  of their control and I think the outcome  is determined by luck and because of  that what happens is they always go to  safe route they go for the capsule  guaranteed returns you go for the six  deposits they go for the fixed a job  having never maximize their fullest  potential now people who change the  world people are really rich releases or  who lived a life to the fullest the huge  calculated risk why is that because  they're not afraid of failure it's not  because a lot of guts is because rich  people in successful people they believe  that your outcome can be  on through by risk management but  managing probabilities something risky  in your mind becomes nervous at all okay  now how does that work okay let me give  you an example again how many examples  can give you are just going to give you  one now I work with a lot of people who  are self-employed sales people whether  they're selling houses or insurance and  so forth so I'm going to give you an  example of how these people think now if  I give you a choice I said okay choice  number one I give you a six-page no  matter what happens you get your fixed  fee every month  of $4,000 fixed pace all right let's go  of course with every job there's a  chance of being retrench when you get  all that the chance of getting a pay cut  you know a chance that you may not get  promoted right comes with this territory  now what if I give you a second choice  and I say okay here's a sales job where  there's no fix thingy nothing you don't  sell don't get anything off for every  sale you make every sale you make you  earn a commission of $1,200 okay and of  course as a self-employed person you  can't get retrench you can't get a pay  cut because it is complete up to you now  which one is more risky the majority of  people say wow this is more risky why I  could get nothing you know if I got bad  lot of stuff okay and they say this is  less risky this is certain now here's  interesting things people who are a top  entrepreneurs where the top  self-employed sales people who are  millionaires you know they say they say  this is risky  scary you know why how'd it go four  thousand can go up  I can go retrench I can lose everything  but this is safer now how do they feel  that this is safer when you know that  there's no fix here's how they think  they think in terms of probabilities and  they manage there is to control the  outcome for example this is how the  things they think okay what's my goal be  always at the goal in mind if they say  my goal is to earn let's say 10,000 a  month in income right so they say okay  so that is a hundred and twenty thousand  dollars a year income so that's a goal  so they figure is every sale they make  it's a thousand two hundred how many  sales must they make to hit that total  income target well the answer is one a  hundred sales or 100 coins so they know  okay to under income I have to get 100  customers now how do they get customers  now in any sales job you meet with  people and you present them a product  you do a presentation and you buy from  you right now of ten people you meet any  presenter not everyone will buy okay  maybe two of I maybe triva but it  depends on your level of skill now we  call that your closing rate the more  skillful you are the higher closing rate  so it's an entrepreneur we calculate  what of closing rate right now so see  right now when you start their closing  rate is 25% our 4 1 by 3 will not buy  it's called the law of averages which  means to get a hundred clients how many  people must be presented 400 rightly  must make 400 presentations or they must  have 400 what we call appointments to  meet people assuming that one for will  buy right now for our appointments is  that a lot yeah okay but it's one year  right so if you divide it by 312 days  assuming you don't work on Sunday okay  that will equal to roughly about one  point three appointments per day which  means they know on average if every day  they see one point three of a percent  how do you do that okay there's an  average way so say Monday they see one  Tuesday the see one when is a DC to what  an average a thing wants to do a date  they want to do it consistently they'll  get a cup outcome now the question is  how do they get these appointments how  did you get these people to come and see  them in the first place well that's it  that's where they go out there and they  do cold calling  they go and meet people they do network  in a give it a name cards right and  again that's also a probability like  they may copy it off  ten people I call it a hi my name is  Adam my name is Mary I like to meet you  with an appointment to talk about this  car nobody's home loan will you beat me  and you know the after not always say  yes  again there's always an average they  often one were failures and I was slam  the phone as they get lost right so if  one out of ten will say yes how many  calls must limit to get four  appointments  four thousand times then right you must  make four thousand call cause of its for  other people strangers how much is that  well the variant well that works out to  be roughly about thirteen calls are they  so now they know okay if every day I  make thirteen costing costing call and  every day I see one to two people  consistently working constantly a year  then will they make that ten thousand  all the month well the answer is is no  guarantee they may or may not make the  ten download amount even if they don't  woody get some way around there yeah  because there's a lot of probability and  the law of averages they've worked out  the odds so if you don't make ten  thousand they may make for example maybe  nine thousand or eight thousand of seven  or whatever but isn't it still better  than the 4,000 now let's assume for some  reason they really bad or they are  really unlucky at their job initially  and I'll stand people no one says yes  they've got a cost twenty four want to  say yes instead of four and one by all  four they go to see eight and one biased  so as a result instead of making ten  thousand they make half you make only  five thousand for example but they  really wanted to make ten thousand what  they do you'll just do double of  everyone else right instead of making 13  calls they make twenty six called  victories it's all instead of seeing one  to two people day they see five a day  so in other words they are result is in  your hands they know that they can turn  whatever income they want as long as you  know the probabilities you're willing to  manage it and this same rule applies for  investments as well okay  for example people say to me Adam you're  risk-taker you invested all these stocks  for example real estate do all of them  make money of course on to campaign on  average not all the moving money but  because I know the choose the right  stocks based on fundamental analysis  thank goodness I know on average of 10  so 5 by 7 will make money  three will lose money but I don't care  all right because as long as the tree  that loses money I cut my losses and  manage my wrist and a seven that makes  me money that makes me my Millions and  that's how risk is perceived so I hope  you understand that you want to be  successful take huge coffee at risk okay  when you can manage the risk the risk  becomes risk free in your mind thank you  for listening  [Music]
