principle number one we'd perceive  reality none of us do we all perceive  our own filtered perception of reality  let's make sense wants ability in other  words I'm already done for you guys our  perception of the world is merely our  perception is not reality does make  sense that's why two people can watch  the same movie one who saves fantastic  won't say it is terrible yes I know so  we all have a path we all have a  different one we all have a different  one model of the world okay now listen  break happy guys if you want to  influence people you have to understand  that they have a different model of the  world from you because if you think that  people see the world the way you see the  world you will always get very  frustrated  you always think a hoppy thing like that  how can they say things around what's in  your haina have you ever thought that  way before because you are judging them  from from your well yes or no but if you  are able to enter the our world to  understand the appellees and BR verbs  and their perceptions what it do makes  complete sense does make sense so once  you're that people have a different mode  of the world how do we influence that  the positive way first thing is this we  need to first enter be our model of the  world and then we can change it for the  better and you learn exactly how to do  this in this program and let me give you  a break quick example right now let's do  if your role playing are you going guys  do that ok so let's imagine I'm your son  okay  and you're my parents now I'm gonna say  something to you I want you to respond  the way you would normally respond as a  parent okay now don't think too much  just respond are you really okay  so I mentioned I go to you and I say  mommy mommy I think studies a waste of  time how can you say that okay very good  denne denne that teacher in school right  sucks there so I fill my mess but he  just sucks how did you agree on the boy  very good at it  give them a hand come on hang on  now let me ask you this how give your  parents okay  if your kids it to you starting is a  waste of time  how would most parents respond what do  you think most parents in have you theme  of spare to say are you crazy  studies important is for your future you  better study whether you like you or not  yes or no now when you do that what  happens  are you matching of mismatching their  world miss Patrick and the moment you  mismatched guess what yeah mango peel em  IDO and no matter what you say how much  you say they will not listen to you  that's big size same thing if your  consist you that teacher sucks in school  and you say hey don't be rude don't rest  disrespect teacher you must respect your  teacher understand you would never  listen to you anymore  let's make sense so let me issue a tank  you want a little sec Nick  okay very good whenever someone has a  different way of thinking or has a sound  resistance you always start by saying  I agree I understand and I appreciate so  far it's not policy I also trained kids  once in one and a kid said to me  sometimes other man studies are waste of  time so I always say to them you know  what I agree it's a waste of time and  you got other spells and the M&P don't  yeah that's how you build a cornet make  sense now what is what if you don't  agree do you lie don't lie laughs and  you can say I understand you feel it's a  ways off and always match your model of  the world first and after you say that  of course you can stop their lap and say  I agree it's a waste of time or never  see the way back never ever see the way  back the what but as a cop you need that  communicate the creates resistance in  people it's like what you say what you  say is true but people feel very  defensive never use the word back use  the word  no no however the seem it's bad  use the word and all at the same time  all right and then what you do after  that is you do a reframe in this program  the most powerful thing you're gonna  learn is called reframing reframing is  that are of changing people's  perceptions the best politicians lawyers  teachers parents or do this okay let me  give you an example when a kid says to  me  Adam ah studies a waste of time I will  say to them I agree study it's a ways  off if you don't know why you're siding  with if you are studying for your father  for your mother that is always off time  at the same time if you have a goal then  you want to achieve but you'll be  somewhat very successful then spotting  will give you the knowledge to get em  much faster than other people you know I  guess it  let me repeat that I agree that spotting  is not I'm sorry I agree I agree that  studying the ways off hi if you don't  know why you're sniping you're starting  for your father for your body is always  off mine at the same time if you have a  go that you really want to achieve  you'll be someone great successful  starting will give you the skills and  knowledge to get them much faster than  other people so notice at any point of  time was I disagree  I always uh agree and then reframe and I  said we call this verbal Aikido have you  heard of Aikido I curious a martial art  where the tissue see no need martial  arts right when people punch while you  blow it I hero the issue when people  punch you don't resist them when they  punch we step aside and redirect Janna  make sense  all right let me give you another  example very quickly  she sells life insurance so when she  keeps you said up one of the most common  objections I get from people is they  tell me Laurie I'm still young I don't  the insurance then last time she'll say  no you're still young but you need to  buy insurance when you're young and I  said and they get very one be fancy  because you never want to disagree with  your children with your crime because  they will not listen to you so I taught  her this tiny her sales conversion went  up by sixty percent or even more you  don't know what she did when she met the  crime and the client said I'm young I  don't insurance Lauren would say yes I  understand  I agree you're young and you don't  insurance that's why you need to buy  insurance because insurance is something  you buy when you don't need because when  you need it you can't buy anymore so now  you don't need right now so you must buy  what's next time we need okay so there  but these are always agree and real  frame is that powerful guys you will  learn how to apply this to every area of  your life okay  now this program is only run once a year  only run once a year and it's an  international program so we're having  people from all around the world coming  in fact I've only got less than about 24  places left I think we have got people  from Philippines Indonesia from the  states from Japan from Australia from  Sweden someone from Spain coming as well  right so they're all coming for this one  event once a year all right
