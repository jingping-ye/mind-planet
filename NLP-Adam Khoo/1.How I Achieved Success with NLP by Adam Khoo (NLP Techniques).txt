specifically clinic  vehicle book if someone can wake up  every morning 6 a.m. and you send a  state and run for five kilometres could  you I know you're looking Michigan the  new way of Costigan is false question  how do you again condition or for any  motions with you people running and we  consistently right and usually be it's  someone who said in final stage of  10,000 people and you relaxed and  confident and has the ideas flow when  other freak out could you occur again is  how you condition your thoughts and  emotions with your console and calm  under stressful situations if someone  will get a financial markets and under  extreme stress in a market will happen  down in making a great decision to  achieve consistent profits could you do  that of contribute and they find what  the best traders in the world the best  teachers in the world to achieve those  results so that's what you will stand  for so now it's not bone linguistic and  I will stop  so linguistically what language RPGs are  worth to NLP you discover how work on  language affects your mind elective  emotions now is it possible that  something I've seen inspire someone of  course it is also positive something I  say it could upset somebody sure because  words affect thoughts emotions actions  results and that's what makes great  leaders great great leaders not to use  certain words to uplift people to drive  people to action let me give an example  you can say to someone hey you better  change okay I want you to change now  using that language what's gonna happen  people are too defensive you're going to  feel like why should I change right I  want to change my room and I said  something like you know I believe that  your kids will achieve so much more and  I know that you're the problem in the  change do what happened slightly  different feeds a different response so  just changing language trees keeps the  mind if you are parent and you go back  home and you see up here watching TV and  not standing and you say don't get a  what else wrong you watch role of your  boy right so when you have that question  what's wrong with you your weapons  you're installing that believe that  something's wrong with you so they don't  grow up anything that you're some things  only something told me right and that's  a subconscious mind that creates fear  and doubt at same time you are someone  absorbing you know they focus on  anything absorber so you gotta be  careful a reference to certain words you  use every single day on your children on  your customers and colleagues does it  inspire them as you drive them today  action possibly or definitely more like  them now this is communicating the  people around you you also communicate  yourself every single evening talk  yourself notice of your thinking do I  want myself I don't of myself but I'm  not myself care of course dr. Bell some  demons are consciously in fact the  average person we talked ourselves about  60,000 times a day right and anything  the people the witty colleges themselves  dis important peculiar power so they  learn how to communicate ourselves in an  empowered way just an example everyone  when do we go what you save yourself  Donna what people normally for many eyes  they taught themselves is really go or  pensive how much longer can I see okay  so you said yourself are you focusing on  witty power or going to see right we're  going to see this on you oversleep right  and it's not people be all in your eyes  the first thing ago and it's a is five  more minutes five more minutes  no ten more minutes and that's what is  procrastinating right now same thing  happens in other areas go I know there  are people who are depressed very often  they get depressed easy and some people  who are happy go lucky wire  it's how the popular cells see people  want in transferring often how do you  think they talk to themselves what they  see things like why does this always  happen to me  you know once my son said you know why  me and I can bet you when you talk  yourself that way your program your  little sister to get a dress now people  who are happy all the time  they who have challenges if you go  through difficulties I talk dissing it  themselves no matter what they say to  themselves what what can you learn from  this  how can this make me a stronger person  no matter what I was finally are always  I do it and they have developed  confidence same things one other people  who are born who always you being put  and why that people who are born were a  queen well is how you top yourself  you're nervous ISM right if you are  always full and they say this video I  can't afford it I'll never for it  and when you say that you're shutting of  the possibility completely you will  never find me after what one poor well  I'm a Tribble  and recruited by the Queen well what  they see themselves is lifting by the  what the guys having a great beautiful  car  and night house you know how can I  afford it how can I walk there and one  day I'm gonna fall it is when that  happens you get increase your  impossibility entirely sessions talking  to yourself your mind every single day  you keep talking some people around your  children your police what happens after  while you program them you program  yourself to the third element what NLP  is about programming that's right as  human beings we run programs everything  of it behavioral programs emotional  programs and simple layman language we  call them habits for everything having  your life if you're depressed all the  time is because your program yourself be  depressed if you're wealthier programs  are be wealthy and that's why the some  people who have been programmed in  reality even we love their money  temporary because of business failure in  a couple of years immediate extra funds  where some local programs were right so  even if the enhancement money we need to  evolve see what happens the musicians  part because they were program keep  money the instructional program to be  happy so even if you go to feeling  better sleeping something terrible's  ridiculous are you angry but very  quickly get over it they get a  confidence back and inside back to begin  gain their former glory right some  people you know according to each travel  time so no matter what happens they keep  getting back to the program so the first  thing is to understand what are the  programs that rule your life right now  do you have a fear program they've  stopped using taking action use the self  dot program that stops you from going  through due to the depression program  and sapping your energy  so once understand the programs that you  run you can reprogram yourself and using  the tools of a of unity  exactly  talking to the how to reprogram anything  from of fear to confidence to motivation  so how fast could programming take place  let's do it  so on the run I'm gonna sugar would and  I do not shop it without as next time  you can mention order of ten prime rate  shall be that really go toss again
