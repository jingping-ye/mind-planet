everywhere I go when I talk to people I  ask people this question and I find this  there less than 10% of people out there  ah committed to really achieve the  success that they want in their life how  many percent only 10% now is this good  news or is this better  depends on how you look at it to me I  think this is good news because if only  10% committed to succeed easier for me  to succeed I got less competition in  saloon right now am I saying that the  rest want to succeed no I tell you this  90% of people out there in like 90  percent they want to succeed they wish  to succeed they hope to succeed they  like to succeed they think they should  succeed they prefer to succeed they  thing is very nice to succeed but there  are no one copy to do something it's a  gentleman again if you told on anything  from you today learnt this is the most  powerful idea what is the difference  between saying I committed to be  financially free I've committed to clear  all my debts I'm committed to lose  weight compared to I wish I was the  difference what's the difference guys  persistence what else here's the  difference when is it coming when you  are committed to a goal committed to a  life that you want is not a wish it's  not a hope it's not I like it becomes an  absolute must  that's it then everyone said what must  when something is a mask to you do you  think differently from everyone else  when something is a must  it becomes priority number one nothing  gets you it nothing stops us when  something is a mass willing to do  whatever it takes to get the result if  it means you have to change your mindset  you would change your mindset if it  means you to get up your comfort zone  you get up your comfort if you miss you  could invest money invest fine you  invest money in your time is enough how  do you believe that if you're willing to  do whatever it takes on something you  will always find a way let me tell you  something I have achieved what I cheap  in life not because I'm smarter than me  - not because I'm more talented but  because when I want something it's a  must like phobia I must make more than  three million dollars a year it's a mass  it's not a wish  I must I must we have this great energy  I must have a fantastic marriage  I must have fantastic relationships it  is a mass and that's what it happens but  people while you I wish I hold back like  I think I should i what they think  action years alone yes they'll pick  action as long as it is what easy I do  not difficult to do they will pay action  as long as it is convene at what time I  do not want to help you how people agree  that to achieve anything worthwhile in  life is never easy  hello it is easy right everyone will be  successful but I face people who succeed  are willing to do things failures are  not willing to do years ago have you  agree that to achieve anything before in  life is never convenient it is always  one inconvenient there's always a  trade-off you need to make on your time  in your money let's make sense okay so  let me ask the question how many of you  again want to succeed happy of you are  committed to succeed really  very good because you see a hobby to  succeed do whatever it takes nothing  stops you there's no excuse this  whatever it is that's it
