thinking like some  people they come to this cause they say  either the most important thing for me  is I want to increase my income right  that's my priority right now off to  increase my five figure income plus six  figure income that's always what I  wanted I must achieve that in the next  you know two or three years okay some  people say our most important thing is I  want to get out of debt  I'm clear on my bed we financially free  in the next few years some people say  it's my career I want to get a slip  promotion I got this guy from Singapore  Airlines who came said I'm gonna make my

so how many of you have found  something please say aye  okay great now second activity this time  I laid right now okay what are all the  things that have been stopping you from  achieving your goals in life what are  all the things that have been stopping  you from achieving what you want in life  right you don't make a list ready go  okay so again some people say what's  stopping me is I don't have the money  to start that business I always wanted  to start you know I believe that I'm the  type exercise moves away right I don't  have the confidence to trade the  financial markets right what's stopping  me my my boss is stopping means an  [ __ ] right oh my wife is stopping me  right husband's stopping me or what's  stopping me is I don't have the luck I  don't have opportunities right right now  everything that is stopping you in your  life right now go ahead I've got a  question for you guys um I hope you feel  that what what's stopping you from  achieving what you want in your life are  external factors external factors like  things like you know no money I don't  have the right connections you know an  economy whatever have you a few external  factors are stopping you raise your  hands okay and hope you feel that it's  really the internal factors that are  really stopping you what's inside of you  most of you interesting and if you ask  most people out there he would cite what  external factors right like the most  common is what stopping me I don't have  the okay  I read the money right right you to live  my dreams to start a business I don't  have done how come you know it's what at  the time right don't have the  opportunity alright don't have the right  boss don't have the right wife or the  right husband right what's stopping me  is I don't have the you know the  connections I have the network so and so  far right okay but if you think about it  the reality is is it is for the external  factors what's really stopping us is the  other what it turn of factors things  like our Esther I suppose it's fear  right first of all our thoughts the  thoughts we entertain right our beliefs  about what I saw its opposite but our  emotional states and fear is an  emotional state as you know our habits  right our skills or lack of certain  skills our actions  now how many of you agree that to  achieve what we want in life you need  sterno resources you need external  resources of course you do right have  you realize that you can acquire any  external resource if you first are able  to master the internal resource right  for example you say I've got more money  to start the business but if you have  got a fantastic one idea you've got some  great ideas for example or you have D  you have no high level confi then and  you have the skill to influence and to  persuade can you influence people to  invest in your idea yes or no okay if  let's people to lend you the money yes  or no yes right at the same time you've  always said to me Adam I don't have time  to excel in everything right  I wrote the time to be a great mom you  know run a successful business and so on  so far I don't have time to write a book  let's have the exercise and give my kids  in career but other people out there  were able to balance their life with who  I would excel in many areas yes or no of  course now is it because they have more  time they go to 70 level to buy time  every day no all right we all have the  same time but the reason able to do that  is because they don't have this heavy  rock rest in a and the true how do you  feel that if you can overcome this heavy  called procrastination you're able to  get yourself to take action immediately  you become a lot more productive and you  can actually achieve a lot more in the  same time you have how do you agree that  say I this make sense so I can tell you  that you know in the last 25 years of my  life my dad before you treat your  Sabbatini for a long time for the last  25 years of my life I've been obsessed  with one question and a question has  been what makes the difference in  people's life what makes people turn out  so differently in life right  why is it that some people end up to be  no very successful very healthy very  happy very fulfilled but they're also a  lot of people who end up what unhappy  bro and missus went unfulfilled  essential and we like to think that or  is the environment that they were in  cutoff people who were born with a lot  of privileges people were born in great  environments right they've got great  family given a lot of money love  education but it turned out to be people  who have got no Drive no fire no and and  they become unhappy unfulfilled and even  someone self-destruct if there's no like  did you read about in the papers  recently this guy guru is named lon  he's the grandson of the founder of  Metro uri mother and his father is the  chairman of Metro so he comes from a  very rich wine family's given all the  money all the support all the education  but what did we know and know at least  like four years old  he's going to jail for taking one taking  drugs right and it'll be about someone  like Jackie Chan's son who is caught JC  chime up in him also taking drugs right  why because you can have all the great  advantages but you can't manage your  internal state you destroy everything  make sense but are they also people who  are born with tremendous disadvantages  people we read about born if no arms and  or it's got panic voyage but now he said  inspiration to the world people like  Oprah Winfrey who was sexually and  physically abused for 15 years right was  raped and nine years old Oprah  repeatedly and she got pregnant at  prayer right Rick by the cousin and gave  us gave birth to a stillborn child a  person like Steve Jobs was given way at  birth  right and a doctor by a poor family so  much so that what he dropped off  University because the parents couldn't  afford to pay the the school fees but  what happened to these people did they  turned out with people who are courage  confidence compassion determination  people who change the work in their own  way as make sense so it is not that it  is not one it is not the external world  that shapes who we become as enough but  our success depends only one thing our  ability to master our internal resources  and we all have that ability yes or no  yes and I put it into two parts right  the first I call it  personal mastery which is anything that  you want in your life  excellence in your life you got a  personal mastery now let's all say  together ever say personal mastery what  does it mean what is personal mastery  okay let me explain so personal mastery  is your ability to consistently bring  out the best in your cell people is  personal mastery are very well a very  focus or what do you want they know  exactly what they want  whereas most people are very distracted  in loose focus all the time you know  people if personal mastery are able to  constantly motivate themselves every day  to take one actually - for true on what  they want is enough where's most will  procrastinate people if personal mastery  have a very high level of confit there's  if you're extremely high confidence they  dead do things that other people fear  web yourself down right now these people  do they go through setbacks  ileus yes but no matter how many times  life knocks them down what happens they  keep bouncing back stronger than ever  before they've got a never-say-die  attitude that that resilience and  determination ISM we call it aq  adversity quotient  now that's personal mastery okay so  let's the master your focus confidence  motivation resilience right is this  something that you are born with or  something that you develop that you can  learn let's do a board okay in Singapore  booty is compulsory let's prepare for  the elections okay so who says is  something you're born with it's a  personality like some baby pop computer  some babe  okay who says is something which you  develop that you learn okay  who says it's both the answer it is both  we are all born in different  personalities yes or no and I can tell  you this when I was in school I had  friends with natural leaders right when  actually confident and outgoing and  drive it right I or someone naturally no  one have you are naturally drawn like me  so I was someone who had to you know II  forced myself to get off my comfort so  and change my mindset to become the  person I needed to be to achieve what I  want that's make sense so the good news  is that yeah we're all born different  we're all different but God what do we  call it give us the power to I'll change  if we choose to change make sense okay  now if you've got tremendous personal  mastery okay you super confident spot  multimeter super focus would you  definitely achieve what you want in life  yes or no yes or no no because it's a  second mastery which is just as  important and the second mastery is  called well it better how you define  like machining people mastery people  mastery everyone say people must really  most people mastery people master is  your ability to not only bring out the  best in yourself but you have the  ability to bring out the best in other  people you have the ability to influence  people to inspire people to move people  this possess all right  in fact how many of you believer that to  achieve anything in life you must  influence another person okay like for  example in a cop will have you are  working that work okay is it the person  who's the most intelligent the most  qualified the most loyal who gets  promoted yes or no no in the real world  is the person who knows how to  that's right it's a person who knows how  to build the right relationships with  the right people who knows how to build  rapport with the decision-maker says no  it's the person who knows how to sell  themselves better than anyone else who  knows who to sell their ideas yes or no  yes yeah okay how smart you are may  degree if you can't sell yourself you'll  be never given the opportunity if I have  more people who deserve a promotion who  these who are qualified but didn't get  it because you're not able to sell  themselves having people like that and  isn't it a waste if you don't have that  skill right same thing let's say you an  entrepreneur right you start your own  company you've got a great vision you  are  you've got great strategy right but if  you can't inspire the people to die for  you  if you can't inspire your team to fight  for you to build a company can you build  a successful business yes or no oh you  can a very good case in point recently  it's the u.s. elections I don't know how  have you follow the u.s. politics I feel  it very closely because I think it's  like riveting drama Hillary Clinton and  all the Trump who was more qualified  Hillary Clinton right  who who is more sane  huh Hillary Clinton who's more  experienced here who support ethical  good person wants to help the world  Hillary right but Donald Trump won why  because I don't care how smart you are  how good a person you are but if you can  influence people to vote for you you  would not be elections so you will not  get promoted that's make sense guys and  it's bracele because Hillary Clinton  have everything but people just didn't  like her because she felt they thought  she was too stuck-up she was arrogant  she could not reach out to people  where's Trump but you have to say one  thing about you must say my father he  knows how to push the right buttons he  knows how to get people to get fired up  that's make sense but if you can combine  both you can achieve anything that you  want to know it and that's really my  secret I like to show you how you can  give up this yourself right same thing  how many of you are parents you all  right so imagine even as a parent you  love your child very much you've got all  the knowledge that you want to give to  your child but you don't know how to top  your child the right way and every time  you talk to the Cheung in Hong Kong what  they go whatever and they don't listen  to you but they listen to their friend  listen to be an uncle  yes or no so no matter how much you love  your child you can't help them unless  you know how to influence them in their  world this make sense okay now I want  you to write down awareness is the first  step to change very good so I like to  write down on a scale of 1 to 10 where  do you feel that you are right now in  terms of personal mastery that means  your ability to bring out the best in  yourself you're a little master yourself
