the combination of all states I  should ask you this do these emotional  patterns affect your life you bet it  affect your performance your happiness  the resultant you produce and that's why  you know people like we're got  tremendous telling them knowledge and  qualifications and I know that she's  much like you I because you're already  in the Holy state and everyone when you  wake up if you tire if you sleep easily  why why that's good work today  right when you go to move in let them  sell out of your office  alright we just go to the motion that  although passion they don't send that in  your life and we mean cream of a better  life you say you know I like to start a  business I like to explore the world but  number one it where the idea is going to  interfere with anything work for all  that fear or anxiety or self-doubt and  even believe it actually will start a  business without creating the financial  markets but the moment it will get a  result they want to get some setbacks  the giver right why does it begin to the  doctor fear but at the same time you and  I have both seen people who have been in  avoiding for families we're having  financial challenge we have no financial  or educational background or  qualifications but they're able to spine  changeable why give  people who with and wanting any job of  it excited in compassionate writing will  take massive actually you are who can I  need today what can I start with it now  doing get objected do they fail of  course but these people were like knock  them down guess what they feel excited  easily if you more easily and more  charged up and I think more action  together disaster one plan so it's  really protecting your eyes now we take  a look in your emotional patterns and  questions where who creates your  emotions right as if you create emotions  in other words when you feel fear you're  creating that safe inside of you these  very lot of talking feel somewhat  ashamed yourself what you're picturing  your mind your physiology and I think  that we need to confident you a lot  creating that equal positives so it is  go back this is good why because if you  are creating your emotions it means that  your the power to change it in a  heartbeat then is that okay so why do  most people control and change your  emotions because they never learn how to  change a motions so the leaders will  come in teaching you having the control  again although state and get the state  that creeps resource for you to take  massive action in your life now whenever  I tell people that the trigger emotions  say it's absolutely fun you know what I  mean I pray my loyalty any angry he may  be are fair but the real is and the  environment telling you anything at all  unless you choose to create a state  within yourself depend on how you choose  to interpret what's happening in our our  most powerful over the world in the past  this formula to sharing and the  follicles we will be plus R equals two  oh I wanted to see right he says for any  best right so what it event anywhere is  ending efforts to you from the external  environment  so for example it's not wonderful family  doesn't matter right we go we train   us the market crashes as an  event and the same time you get promoted  as an event right you put a rich family  event so event of things that happened  was in the external world and some  events may seem good and something that  may be bad right now are people they  allow the event to affect the outcome  for example we see things like you know  because of wonderful family and that's  why in our ways before with another  resource I don't be networked and  learning the rules right  Santos video because of refraction  design boss terrible not giving  opportunities in ascending or training  so I create what we're going to be ok  sorry can we control the events that  happen bacchanal I call back no for  example it's a windsurfer or the Sailor  you can't control the wind right there's  no point of focusing on something that  you can control right so people who  succeed in life people who change your  world who get exceptional results is it  because they have got perfect vents is  it because they've got perfect parents  perfect bosses not that economy perfect  background because everything goes  really want of course ridiculous right  if I do read some the most part of our  trophies you realize they're the most  successful the most inspiring people in  the world were born or experienced the  worst bad right nothing Mandela was jail  of 26 years only voyage was by no other  bullet or Steve Jobs who was given away  for adoption but who dropped out of  school because this you know  telephoto pay the tuition on this  university was picked up a whole company  apple anniversary would be that but why  do they are able to change the world  into the resulting one because people  who succeed realize that it is not an  event that affects our outcome that I  got happiness affect our weather affects  our results but well that our outcome is  the way in which we choose to respond  and it is the way in which we choose to  respond and this is where your power  lines especially apology we come with  control outside world right and so on  the movie attend the controller offline  world the most frustrated again right  but we can always control the inside  world the world of thoughts the will of  emotions the decisions make the action  today and I consider the inside world  the outside world changes  so that's little tolerance okay so let  me ask you a question and enter a time  your life when you work very hard on  something or example you work hard on a  relationship on your business on your  career and despite all your efforts  thing to sell true you do not get the  result you want it has experienced  something like that no max I tell you  have that's all about half right  so when that happen how did you feel you  do you know it when an ask people  expression I get different answers some  people say you know I felt angry I felt  more alive I felt upset you know I felt  and you played a great so today we all  feel the same way when things don't go  the way why there is no we of you  differently why because it depends on  how we've been conditioned within  program to respond to events it's  already for programming for under some  people when they lose money for example  right all their business was but how do  they respond you know some people  respond by saying you know why are you  always  happened to me no we were always rooting  the pattern is so stupid after this one  lucky your wife God why did you do this  to me right in all the point I try again  to fill it in and I never the time to  get forget it right and if you respond  that way how do you feel you should be  more or less if you look healthy you  feel tremendously if Netru and who  created that save you live from the  leave responder and if you fear and  dejection will you take more action will  you learn from it probably not right you  go walking will do something else and of  the result the outcome you will not get  the result you want but some people they  put that seeing rejection that things  feel it it lost mind that this is went  bad but you were already different they  are swarming what what can I learn from  this  you know how can this blessing in  disguise  you know how can this event maybe a  stronger or wiser person know how  cleansing what I've learned and go out  there and keep even water but Allah how  can this be the greatest early  experience and breakthrough that I have  a my three there what happens they can  boy transmitted and more confidently  cannot motivator and it takes more  action than action and it better results  and they believe that how you bounce the  ball down now fast the ball comes back  up alright so how would you respond by  happening back let me show you a story  about powerful this fallen can be in an  early base of my business career I'm  going to can attract new people right  this is the sales target with a quarter  going up losing money not frustrate the  SEO life is happening to me right I  thought how can I ever get out of this  mess ended and where a story in a  Singapore Street and newspaper that  really tiny and the story of our men

his business in his  Philippines and he built it to a three  hundred million dollars a year turnover  business  so you're the brave hustle businessman  it was a very wealthy entrepreneur  highly respected now what happened in  the late 1980s the 1990s he was given  all the word event by most entrepreneurs  and one for me life lived on y'all he  expanded his business a bit too fast  right over language she worked on the  banks and there was a three or four hit  by severe recession back in 87 you know  a lot of foreign competitors country  market competitors of Japan on the US  right  like
