I welcome to the winning the game of  life series today I like to talk about  one of the chapters which I love is  called let your emotions serve you and  not enslave you you see as human beings  we've got tremendous potential now we do  make full use of it right really is like  10% and I believe that if you make full  use of your potential maybe it's not a  100 percent but even it's 70 percent you  can achieve almost anything you set your  mind to whether you want to start a  successful business you know build a  fantastic marriage org well then I'm  gonna pop your career whatever it is so  if you think about it we live in a time  where the crews with success are readily  available for example if you want to  have a fantastic marriage get books how  they can read your causes you can  attended teach you the five love  languages write how to communicate for  example if you want to build a  successful business there are courses to  teach you on how to do that there are  books you can read even be a successful  investor again there are strategies on  how to invest successfully in other  words in today's era if you achieve  anything in life all you got to do is to  learn the strategies they actually go  and do it and if you make mistakes along  the we learn from the mistakes change  your strategy keep improving and keep  taking action until you get the result  it's as simple as that I tell you so  what doesn't everyone do it why doesn't  everyone go there and learn how to do it  why don't I take action how I don't  apply it  why don't when they when they make  mistakes or they feel they get me do it  again what is stopping them see many  people in life I find they know what to  do some even know how to do it some even  know why they should do it but they  don't do it so what stops people and the  answer product primarily I find it stops  people it's fear down frustration you  know and these are what we call  collectively emotions negative emotions  stop us from taking action and be all  that we can be now there's one time I  wanted myself wouldn't be great if there  were more negative emotions in the world  imagine a world where there's no fear  okay no anger no doubt no frustration we  just feel happy every day we just felt  joy we just for excitement wouldn't it  be great but that Buffalo why did I'll  create the create negative emotions  okay see I believe everything happens  for a reason you know the reason why  monkeys have tails is because they run  up the trees we don't have tails because  you don't climb trees right so  everything happens for purpose so why do  we have negative emotions I believe our  Creator didn't give us negative emotions  to punish us but it serves a purpose a  positive purpose and here's the purpose  negative emotions are there to give us  signals to give us messages and the  signal is that we need to change if we  need to change our perception or  thinking or we need to change our  actions that's a signal give you an  example  have you experienced fear before we all  have right we all experience fear when  we do something new we do something  really challenging so why do we have  fear when we have fear that emotion is  giving us a signal  the signal is that we need to get  prepared we need to increase our skills  we need to increase our knowledge we  need to improve ourselves that's a  message for example you know I give  talks all the time I give speeches  keynotes to you know hundreds thousands  of people I can tell you this before I  give a thought I still feel fear I still  have got to feel like I got a feel oh my  god what if I screw up what if they  don't like me what if I don't mean the  expectations I get fear and it's good  because when I get that fear it tells me  the Adam I better get prepared so you  know I know I spent a lot of time doing  research rehearsing rehearsing  rehearsing crafting my slides and I good  and I do my very best  I imagine if I had no fear at all you  know what I'll be complacent  I won't practice I won't rehearse I  won't do my slides properly and I will  not do a good job so it's in feel good  so if you feel fear in life good it  means you're a human being right and  that's nothing wrong with there but  things to let that fear send you that  positive message and you take action and  you prepare until that fear goes down  when the fear goes down it means this  you're prepared instead don't lie be out  don't be like other people when they  feel that fear they run away they let  the fear paralyze them in other words  they allow the emotions to overtake them  and they don't get the message they  don't improve they don't learn anything  so remember let emotions serve you and  not enslave you  [Music]
