[Music]  welcome to the winning the game of life  series you know today I'm going to focus  on the key to lasting happiness one of  the chapters in my book and you know  happiness isn't that what we all won  isn't that the ultimate aim many times  when I ask people in life know what's  your goal and you tell me to be happy  and when they say that to me I say I've  got bad news and I got good news for you  the bad news is if your goal in life is  to be happy you will never ever achieve  this goal and they say why and see  because happiness is not a goal to be  achieved happiness is a state of mind in  which you're in right now in other words  it's right now you want to be happy  pretty happy could you yeah  all you got to do is focus on all the  things in your life which are grateful  for focus on all the things that you  have that people don't have like for  example the fact that you could have  career you've got your family you got  your health you live in a country where  you're free to explore and learn and  you'll be happy right but today no  matter what you have kind of all the  houses you have all the cars all the  money could you feel depressed right now  of course all you got to do to focus on  every little thing in life that bugs you  focus on everything that doesn't meet  your expectations and you be depressed  right now I can tell you something no  matter where you are in life they'll  always be things that bug use you always  be thing that does not match your  expectations and some people experts in  it and so they always you depress in  other words if you can't be happy today  if you do not be happy today you will  never ever be happy because happens the  state of mind and gotta practice  happiness you know in my line of work I  work with all kinds of people I don't  people extremely wealthy I've got this  friend of mine who married this  multi-millionaire right and her husband  is worth a few hundred million dollars  and she's basically someone who's like a  housewife but she doesn't work at all  she listened his 20,000 square-foot  bungalow she's got this old  mercedes-benz her own driver  she wears prada she was Gucci she plays  mahjong every day she goes shopping  every day right anything that this woman  must be absolutely happy I guess why  she's depressed  in fact she's on drugs you know she she  takes these antidepressant pills every  time I talk to her she's got this is  common sense and she's always miserable  when I asked you know what's wrong she  said everything's wrong you know my  driver comes late you know my maid you  know I am I dressed properly I losted  mahjong and my husband you know came  back late and you know nothing location  press okay  but I've also motive people what were  you know when I do charity work with  like you know certain groups we go to  one room flat you know government flats  and we give away free food I think two  flats we're just one room seven people  in a one room they've got no TV no  computer games they lie on the floor mat  your slope what are you happy you know  when I go then I give them food the kids  run up to me and it say hi how are you  the men of the house is smiling and get  genuinely so happy so what I come to  realize is that you know what happiness  doesn't come from outside it's not like  some magical does it touches you and you  become happy right happiness comes from  inside all that joy is already inside  you waiting to get out but we all have  rules in our hair rules of what must  happen before we give ourselves  permission to be happy like to some  people the rule is as long as I do my  best  some of the people I care about I'm  happy and that's why they are always  happy these are a happy-go-lucky people  right there are some people they've got  this rule of your hair that says you  know what only when everything goes the  way I want then I'll be happy and so  they always be pressed because in life  nothing ever goes the way we want  because we kept of the rules you set up  for yourself in the past I used to have  this believe that I have to achieve to  be happy that was my rule okay I said to  myself you know the day I make my first  villain I'll be happy the day I buy my  bundle I'll be happy the day I buy my  sports car I'll be happy the day I get  married I'll be happy so I went for all  these things in life so question was  when I got all these things was I happy  yes I was really happy for one day and  guess what  three days later also depressed again I  was stressed again thinking I know after  cheese something else to keep being  happy it was insane because I was only  happy you know five or one percent of  the time and 99% I was unhappy striving  to get what I think made me happy  so instead today I'm going to drink the  lost in life I believe that instead of a  choosing to be happy we need to happily  achieve happily achieve in other words  we've got to find the joy of doing what  we do every day  find the joy of solving problems of  meeting challenges find the joy of  working with people I find the joy of  creating distances both the problems in  the business and the ability to meet  people find a joint writing books that's  what I do I find a joy in making this  video  okay but I will be getting up so early  in the morning to make this video right  now okay  so enjoy the journey because when you  find that you become happy along the  journey you know what you don't have to  discipline yourself you are naturally  motivated all right you tend to wait you  tend to find out when you are happy in  life doing what you do you tend to do  your best work naturally so join me in  this journey of being happy alright and  enjoy it  [Music]
