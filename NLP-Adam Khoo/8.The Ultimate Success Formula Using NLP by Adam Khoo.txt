how do you think there's a formula for  success all right thank you how do you  think there's no formula for success  right the good news is there is a  formula for success right success rarely  happens by chance people who are  successful where is it at Joseph's  schooling who is the best in sports or  someone who's the best sales or  someone's the best in business there's  certain core qualities they have in  combinational and I call this the I call  this the ultimate success formula and if  you really understand this formula and  you apply it I can tell you this you  achieve excellence excellence in every  area I've used this from my academic  studies to my business to my training to  everything right so let's let's begin to  understand this what you think is the  first step  what's the first thing they're all very  successful people have in common to  begin that journey huh passion okay what  else  passion what else what's the first thing  they all have in common focus believe  try what's it vision just now right I'll  say the first thing people who succeed  is because at one point of time in their  life they got absolutely clear on  exactly what it is that they wanted  number one they know exactly what they  want in other words they set very clear  and specific what those and only to  reset the goals but they're able to  focus on it consistently every single  day it becomes an obsession that's exact  now you may say that sounds like common  sense I know what you want of course but  let me ask you this do you think most  people know what you want to I can tell  you after working with so many people  over the years I find that more than 90  percent of people don't know what you  want they know what leave the one  they know what they've done but they  don't really know what they won and even  thought they BC they know what they want  it is very well it's very it is not  specific as you know is it all a big  more money how much money I do know as  much as I can know what you are I want  to be more successful in my career but  exactly where do you want to be in your  career one year five years from now my  boss let me ask you a question how many  of you can tell me that three years from  now five years from now you have a very  clear vision of where you will be in  your career or your business or honestly  come on how many of you are not clear  yet thank you for being honest how he  can tell me that three years five years  from now you are very clear where you'll  be in terms of your network and your  income you very clear idea where you'll  be your network your income and  everything you're moving towards that  fantastic help you honestly I'm not  clear yet all right so you can see most  people are not clear but is this  something that you can't learn yes or no  yes so one of the most important parts  of this program is you're gonna learn a  process of how to design your design  your destiny because success does not  happen by one chance  it doesn't happen by chance all day  every day you will have a look at what  had a wonder you wake up I'm a villain  oh hey there one day we got a  financially free won't that happen by  chance  No if you want to be financially free  five years from now six years about  seven years from now what must you do  now you must make a DC sure of how much  you need capital to be financially free  or how much you need to invest every  single month but how much rid of reason  you need to get about me strips of  income you need to have there must be a  clear one plan that's make sense let me  ask you this if you get married today  after 25 years of marriage right when  you see each other right well you still  have the passion the excitement and the  intimacy yes or no yes or no  the answer is why not but if it happens  it will not happen by chance if after 25  years of marriage you still wonder the  passion the intimacy it will not happen  by chance  it goes every single day you work on  your marriage every single day you  dedicate the time to make each other  feel special do communiy okay to meet  each other's emotional needs to  understand each other's love length so  it does make sense it's all that process  of that right and years ago I learn one  thing my mentor taught me Adam if you  don't pursue your goals in life someone  else will employ you to pursue the other  isn't that true if you don't have a plan  for your life someone else will always  have a plan for you and you fall into  someone else's plan so please when you  come for this program you will go to a  process of how to get clear how to get  clear also get clear get clarity on  where you're gonna be one year two years  five years from them and I say people  who come paying for very different goals  they said like Lori from Prudential  about her goals very clear I will be the  one caught up the table her go make 1  million in commissions a year where she  does today not by chance because that  time it was said I've got people like  Connor Elvin live when he came he say my  ghost be a professional trader in the  financial markets to make at least  30,000 US a man and today he makes a lot  more than that  I have got people like Jackie who say I  I want to lose 30 pounds in six months  and become a competent Toastmasters and  she achieve that and then she said an  exponent right so that's the first step  you're gonna learn here how to get clear  what you want okay now step two once you  know exactly what you want what is that  two guys actually before you take action  you've got to  got a plan right specifically you've got  to have a strategy everyone said oh it's  strategy now let me ask you this  whatever goal you said is there always a  strategy to get there if your goal is to  lose 30 pounds in six months is there  certain strategy of how many calories  you need to burn a week a month is there  strategy how many hours of physical  activity you need to burn those calories  is there strategy of what you can do  what you can do  yes if your goal is to make a million  dollars a year is their strategy of how  many strips of income you need to have  yes or no about the skills you need to  have to peel those incomes yes or no yes  so what is the fastest way to find the  strategy that will get you there you  have a goal right what's the fastest way  to find the strategy it'll get you there  at nlm to cost hey give me some answer  is this now whatever good you said are  there people out there who have achieved  the goal that you want a very exactly  Joseph's schooling right his goal was to  be a only big gold medalist and he asked  who has done it Michael Phelps there's  always someone who is done years alone  when I say only my first led 20 24 26  well time before Anthony Robbins has  done before there's always someone with  that b4 so in NLP we say once you know  what you want you find people who have  done it before and you model them you  model your blueprint everyone silhouette  model so the most powerful thing that I  will share your teacher is not out of  how do you model excellence how do you  model excellence in people my last time  I can tell you this I always wanted to  be a very inspirational speaker I do  know how to do it so I went to watch  videos of the most inspirational  speakers and I'm model the way they use  their body language their way to use  that tonality the facial expression the  way they walk the room  the will use and language matters is  modeling process when I sit I will be  the top student in Singapore at time  what I do  I'm model the top students I went to  find out how did they read how they get  it in for me sure how do they make noise  how do they member right how do we  prepare for exams how do they of what  tell us me is like this is a strategy  make sense so I'll teach you this entire  process of modeling people okay now are  you ready step 3 know what you want find  the strategy but step 3 it's the boss  upon a part of the tree  yeah is to get yourself to pick hot  assistant action okay everyone say  consistent action that means every  single day moving to was there  Oh every single day one step one step or  yes alone okay  now today you have learn one thing what  drives action logic or emotions yes so  what is the main challenge most people  have more feel the challenges is a  logically I want it right I know how to  do it but you don't do it why because  they're not in the right state if you  see a doubt procrastination few years  ago okay  so one of the most important parts of  this program is what you're going to  learn how to be able to change your skin  instantly how many of you think right if  you can get from procrastination to  motivation in a few seconds how do you  think that will change your mind  absolutely how do you think from if you  fear doubt and certainly you can get  absolutely confident in a few seconds  they will change you like there's enough  that is what change my life let me ask  you this do you think every day I wake  up I feel excited know  of course not I'm a human being yeah  this I we can also use ENS alone do you  think every time before I speak to  people I feel very confident host on I  also have fear I'm also human being yes  or no do you think sometimes before I  write my book before i i i trigger the  market you think something I feel bored  sometimes of course I do I'm a human  being I also feel lazy I also feel bored  I also feel yet but it was a different  the moment I'm in that state I recognize  it and I can change it in a habit and  once you can do that you control your  entire life so the entire process will  take you hours and hours of  reconditioning okay now imagine if every  day from now on you take what I should  think I should the exit will you always  get results yes or no who says yes who  says though yes my philosophy what my  philosophy in life is that every time  you take action you will always get  results always you either get results  you want or is also on the truth but you  always get results yes or no but if you  take action and you can result you door  what do you learn something from it yes  are you still better than other people  who only talk and talk and talk and talk  and again and again and talk but don't  do anything at all yes yes at least by  taking action and this you know what  doesn't work and use you get a result  any score points be so tell you are the  biggest secret to succeed in life as  simple as it sounds is to just take one  that's it I can tell you have achieved  so much more than my friends not because  I'm smarter than them but I just  actually what I think our rival I just  right there I don't think I say I want  to treat the financial I just thought  what I don't care I just do a second  result okay so when you take action and  you get the result that you want  oh we call this success everyone say  success  now whenever you take action you always  get the result you want the first time  life is not so simple life is also easy  easy  many times you take action and you get  results you go one way and a lot of  people are free of this that's why they  do it even at the start because they are  free of this D call failure  let me ask you this does everyone feel  in life sometimes yes or no do  successful people feeling like yes or no  in fact they feel more than anyone else  because they pick a lot more action at  the more action you will you take the  more you will feel so the question is  not whether you feel because you will I  guarantee that but a question is when  you fail what do you do about it that is  what makes the difference make sense so  there are three kinds of people in life  are you ready stop you say I know you  know I say what is it believe the  Chinese the first kind of people say  okay I will try so they take action at  the moment they fail what they do that's  right he will give up very easily they  say well I tried it it doesn't work so  why try again yes or no I tried this  trading it make money so why trying it  I tried sales it why why try again have  you know people I read and when they  give up they give themselves lots of  while I don't have what it takes is too  difficult as selling table is enough  tell you got a second group the second  group quick action if they don't get the  result they want you see you one won't  give up try a it sit so they go back and  they pick more action and if they still  fail see they might try a good if they  still fail trial do fail trial till the  trial okay so they keep track again and  again and again eventually will they  succeed yes or no yes or no no why  yeah although they keep trying again and  again and again because they keep they  never change our way they keep doing the  same thing if you keep doing the same  thing the same way you keep getting one  the same result if you keep popping  tanking and your kids the same way you  keep getting the same result whatever if  you keep managing your money the same  way you keep getting the same financial  results if you keep communicating with  your spouse the same way you keep  getting the same result with us in a  relation exact so these people they try  again and again but eventually they get  very well frustrated right yeah I tried  everything so eventually what they do  or eventually they just accept it's my  fate they accept mediocrity how come you  know people in life when we're accepted  mediocrity right so don't ever allow  yourself to be that yes okay then we go  to the third group that you did what we  do they take what don't give me  something up you think I'm okay and when  they talk in the result they want they  don't see it as failure right everyone  say there's no failure if I don't get  the result what I did fail I just got a  result and the result is simply while  the results if you are feedback and the  feedback is not that I can't do it no  that's too difficult the feedback is  there my strategy is not working yes or  no so they're able to take that feed  back and they have this thing called  flexibility I received flexibility to  say what I do doesn't work I must have  the flexibility to change my one  strategy for example in sales you must  be flexible to change the way you will  report the customer  you must be flexible the way you handle  object should must be flexible in the  way in which you follow ah except as a  financial trader you must be flexible  the way you approach the financial  markets  so they keep changing their strategy and  do what and if you fine-tuning changing  their strategy I do what I do what what  guys until they find what look just  enough and how many times they change  your strategy how many times how many  times that's right they will do what  every hey everyone dr. Pacific's to you  please and say do whatever it takes huh  all right now if it's so simple why  doesn't everyone do this if it's so  simple why doesn't everyone do this  because we will never do this we will  never do this until and unless we  reprogram  three parts of our mind this is actually  the operating system and the first part  that affects us the most are our belief  systems right everyone zero eight  beliefs your beliefs right there are 300  of you in the room today you know that  right and you're listening to the same  lesson but do all of you have the same  beliefs and with different beliefs  you're listening to the same lesson but  you're perceiving it differently as  enough let me ask you this for example  if you have this belief that says  example right yes I can make a million a  year I believe it can be done if you  have that belief would you set a  different goal yeah if you have that  belief would you tend to take action  would you find a strategy would you ever  give up don't you want no you won't  because you can be done but the moment  you the moment if a limiting belief you  say you know it's too difficult I don't  have what it takes  it cannot be done once you don't believe  in something what happens where I go you  start to lose focus you know you startle  aim a lot lower on bone marrow and once  you don't believe in yourself you do not  even death while  to take that first step and you would  give up very easily so let me ask you  this how many of you think that in your  life right now you have what beliefs  that are holding you back  how many of you we all do and one of the  most common beliefs that people have is  this belief that belief that sickness  I'm not good enough  how many sometimes have got a voice in  your head that you can't man you should  listen to you right and instead let me  think believe that you know I'm not good  enough and you know put it there  well sometimes sadly the people around  us our parents our friends our teachers  as you know where we were young growing  up will be conditioned how you right boo  you don't worry booger and those were  the things that people thought you pick  me how to go JC those are the things  that people tell us is enough so we must  be able to break break our limiting one  please independence of excellence you  will learn why not all that believes you  have the ones that empower you the ones  that limit you and how do you break  through there was a limit you help your  viewer not only want to change your  beliefs but how many of you have got  people you love lie your children or  your parents with very limiting beliefs  and you like to learn these skills to  help them to shift your - well so they  can become happier in life would you  like to learn that that's exactly what  you can learn in this program not just  for you but the people around you  and I can tell you that from these tools  are able to help my own mother my old  father law my own wine and now my two  children why don't you have it 13 years  old and I'll share a lot more about that  as we go along right now next on the  list of all guys please do that okay now  how do you feel that I feel that you  have a certain goals in your life but  you like the tribe to get there okay how  do you feel that when you were young you  had that drive at one point your life  there's somehow you lost that right how  many of you have you like to get it back  okay now first let's explore what drives  us  what drives you looked at me call taker  was a context what drives up do goals  drivers yes or no  who says goals drivers who says no all  the time the answer is no all the time I  know many people who set all kinds of  goals I want to do this I'll do that  tomorrow goals don't drive you goals  only give you a direction to move to as  ghosts only give you a target  why doesn't get you there so what gets  you there listen up this is really  critical let me use a metaphor  okay let's imagine this is you this is  called a rocket and let's say it's a  rocket your goal is to reach the food  not such that sorta okay now so by  setting that goal right you now have a  one direction a trajectory right but  there's a go get you dinner no but what  gets you there is the few help that will  propel you against the force of gravity  I eat procrastination you're go there's  enough so in human terms what is this  view energy okay so drink reboot pension  or else values Wow exactly now let me  put it this way when you set a goal  you're getting clear what you want  everyone said what what besides the wah  you must also have the how how do I do  it was a strategy is enough now these  two are logical by the third thing the  emotional that drives you it is not the  what's on how is the that's right it's  the wine let me ask you which one is  more important the how of the wine who  says the how who says the wine very good  why  you're right but why why do I yeah how  keep you agree if when you have a strong  enough wine you will fight the huh  now why is that compelling reason isn't  but people can give you order how old  the method or the strategy or the apps  or the causes you go to buy you don't  know why you will never use the house  yes or no so let me give an example how  keep you here would like to earn a  six-figure income raise your hands okay  very good so you see all of you may have  the same what right you want to make  high income right I bet you something  you all have a very different wine what  drives you to make money is very  different from what drives you very  different for what drives me and how do  you think that all of us have our own  unique emotional hot buttons there we  know how to push that right button all  of us can be very driven that's why  we're parents said to be either my son  is really easy I see a rubbish he's not  lazy he's very motivated at something  else like playing computer games to me  there's no such thing as a lazy person  we are all motivated when we find our  wife let's make sense okay and our wine  comes from this thing called our what a  what our values means what's important  to us let me give an example if you look  at Donald Trump and bow Obama right they  were both very driven to become  president United States right did they  have the same goal yes to become  president I say the same goal did they  have the same wine they've got very  different Y values as you know so for  Obama was his values loss is wine he  wanted to be a role model for the black  hole it is no he wanted to help the poor  yesterday right you want to change the  world right now Trump on the other hand  his his values are very different when  his values are power his values I record  me sure I'm not judging what is good was  that  but voice you must know what drives you  under something now  again how do you feel when you were  young you were driven as you grow older  you lost you're drunk  do you know why now I went to the exact  same thing let me tell you why it's  because as you grow older your values  change as you grow older your values  change what was important to you in the  past middle no longer be important you  know this make sense when hours in my  20s my number one value in life at a  time was recognition to be very honest  with you I wanted to make money how to  buy a bundle I'm gonna try the nice  campus I want to be recognized I want  people to to recognize me  and this what drove me but once I got  you know my kids I got a bit more mature  I become 40 years old now I'd really  kept my recognition anymore all right if  I let me just tell you something which  when I put my wife you say are you sure  you know all my life I've always driven  sports cars right BMW a little tears of  Ferris and all those things right and my  car is coming up for you know the series  going on right my wife said yeah am I  gonna get a lot more key minute you say  you wanna get anyway I said to her I say  you know I travel so much I'm honey to  Singapore  I'm just got a big rep Cavanagh  and she said I don't care when you meet  you  I mean at some stage when you when  you're truly wealthy and happy and and  fulfill do you need all those things you  know that's why I don't wear any like  Brenda stuff or jewelry because what  makes you feel confident is what you  have become in the process make this  make sense so what drives me now is I  don't care about buying a new car new  house what drives me is I'm able to  really transform people's lives and  that's why you know I am I'm going on  stage every single dollar are a title so  realize when your own of us
